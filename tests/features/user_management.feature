Feature: User registration with and establishment of an authentication token with AppCloud

	 In order to track service and resource usage
	 As the AppCloud service provider
	 I want users to register and login to use AppCloud.

	 Scenario: Register user
	   Given I am a new user to AppCloud
	   When I register
	   Then I should be able to login to AppCloud.

	 Scenario: Login user
	   Given I am registered
	   When I login
	   Then I should get an authentication token that I need to use with all subsequent AppCloud requests

	 Scenario: Reset user authentication token
       Given I have registered and logged in
	   When I login
	   Then I should get a new authentication token that I need to use for all subsequent AppCloud requests
