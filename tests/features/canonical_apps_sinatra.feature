# The canonical_apps_* tests can be explicitly run via "bundle exec cucumber"
# using "--tags @canonical" on the command line or setting CUCUMBER_OPTIONS
# environment variable when invoking rake tasks.
# Combinations of app(s)/service(s) can now be chosen by combining tags.
# If not passing "--tags ~@delete" the services and apps are
# deleted during the run, and if passed the apps and provisioned services
# are left running at the end of the run.
# To select only one app to run, or a combination app and services use:
# --tags @canonical --tags @node
# --tags @canonical --tags @spring --tags @mysql,postgresql
# --tags @canonical --tags @spring --tags @postgresql --tags ~@delete
