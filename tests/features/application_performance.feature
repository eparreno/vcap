Feature: Measure various performance features of an application

	 As a user of AppCloud
	 I want to measure certain performance related aspects of an application

	 Background: Application creation
	   Given I have registered and logged in

       @creates_redis_lb_app @lb_check @smoke @sanity
       Scenario: start application
         Given I have my redis lb app on AppCloud
         When I upload my application
         And I start my application
         Then it should be started
         And it's health_check entrypoint should return OK
		 And after resetting all counters it should return OK and no data

		 # ensure basic operation works fine with a single instance
		 When I execute /incr 10 times
		 Then the sum of all instance counts should be 10
		 And after resetting all counters it should return OK and no data

		 # ensure basic operation works fine with multiple instances
		 When I increase the instance count of my application by 4
         Then I should have 5 instances of my application
		 When I execute /incr 150 times
		 Then the sum of all instance counts should be 150
		 And all 5 instances should participate
		 And all 5 instances should do within 55 percent of their fair share of the 150 operations
		 And after resetting all counters it should return OK and no data

      @creates_env_test_app @env_test_check @smoke
      Scenario: start application

        Given I have my mozyatmos app on AppCloud
        When I upload my application
        And I start my application
        Then it should be started
        Then it should be bound to an atmos service
        And env_test's health_check entrypoint should return OK
